# Learning the language of viral evolution and escape

This repository contains the analysis code, links to the data, and pretrained models for the paper ["Learning the language of viral evolution and escape"](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/284) by Brian Hie, Ellen Zhong, Bonnie Berger, and Bryan Bryson (2021).

### Data

You can download the [relevant datasets](http://cb.csail.mit.edu/cb/viral-mutation/data.tar.gz) (including training and validation data) using the commands
```bash
wget http://cb.csail.mit.edu/cb/viral-mutation/data.tar.gz
tar xvf data.tar.gz
```
within the same directory as this repository.

### Dependencies

The major Python package requirements and their tested versions are in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

Our experiments were run with Python version 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04.

### Experiments

Key results from our experiments can be found in the [`results/`](results) directory and can be reproduced with the commands below. The [`models/`](models) directory contains key pretrained models used in our analyses.

To run the experiments below, download the data (instructions above). Our experiments require a maximum of 400 GB of CPU RAM and 32 GB of GPU RAM (though often much less); _in silico_ fitness and escape model inference can take around 35 minutes for influenza HA, 90 minutes for HIV Env, and 10 hours for SARS-CoV-2 Spike.

#### Influenza HA

Influenza HA semantic embedding UMAPs and log files with statistics can be generated with the command
```bash
python bin/flu.py bilstm --checkpoint models/flu.hdf5 --embed \
    > flu_embed.log 2>&1
```

Single-residue escape prediction using validation data from [Doud et al. (2018)](https://github.com/jbloomlab/HA_antibody_ease_of_escape) and [Lee et al. (2019)](https://github.com/jbloomlab/map_flu_serum_Perth2009_H3_HA) can be done with the command
```bash
python bin/flu.py bilstm --checkpoint models/flu.hdf5 --semantics \

Combinatorial fitness experiments measuring correlation with grammaticality and semantic change using data from [Haddox et al. (2018)](https://github.com/jbloomlab/EnvMutationalShiftsPaper) can be done with the command
```bash
python bin/hiv.py bilstm --checkpoint models/hiv.hdf5 --combfit \
    > hiv_combfit.log 2>&1
```

Training a new model on HIV Env sequences can be done with the command
```bash

#### SARS-CoV-2 Spike

Coronavirus spike semantic embedding UMAPs and log files with statistics can be generated with the command
```bash
python bin/cov.py bilstm --checkpoint models/cov.hdf5 --embed \
    > cov_embed.log 2>&1
```

Single-residue escape prediction using validation data from [Baum et al. (2020)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/06/15/science.abd0831) and DMS data from [Greaney et al. (2020)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.292078v1.full.pdf) can be done with the command
```bash
python bin/cov.py bilstm --checkpoint models/cov.hdf5 --semantics \
    > cov_semantics.log 2>&1
```

Combinatorial fitness experiments measuring correlation with grammaticality and semantic change using data from [Starr et al. (2020)](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS) can be done with the command
```bash
python bin/cov.py bilstm --checkpoint models/cov.hdf5 --combfit \
    > cov_combfit.log 2>&1
```

Experiments measuring grammaticality and semantic change of a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection event documented by [To et al. (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1275/5897019) can be done with the command
```bash

:warning: Training takes **~15 hours per epoch** on an [akya-cuda](https://docs.truba.gov.tr/TRUBA/kullanici-el-kitabi/hesaplamakumeleri.html#akya-cuda) node (4 x 16Gb GPU).
